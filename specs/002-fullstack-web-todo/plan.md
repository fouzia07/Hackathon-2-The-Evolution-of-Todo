# Implementation Plan: Full-Stack Web Todo Application - Phase II

**Branch**: `002-fullstack-web-todo` | **Date**: 2026-01-07 | **Spec**: [specs/002-fullstack-web-todo/spec.md](../002-fullstack-web-todo/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-fullstack-web-todo/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Transform the existing CLI-based Todo application into a secure, multi-user, full-stack web application with Next.js frontend, FastAPI backend, Neon PostgreSQL database, and JWT-based authentication. The implementation will follow a monorepo structure with separate frontend and backend directories, ensuring proper user isolation where each user can only access their own tasks.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+ for backend, TypeScript for frontend
**Primary Dependencies**: FastAPI, Next.js 16+, SQLModel, Better Auth
**Storage**: Neon Serverless PostgreSQL for persistent storage
**Testing**: pytest for backend, Jest/React Testing Library for frontend
**Target Platform**: Web application with responsive UI
**Project Type**: web - monorepo with separate frontend and backend
**Performance Goals**: API response time p95 < 200ms, authenticated user isolation
**Constraints**: <200ms p95 API response time, user data isolation, JWT-based authentication
**Scale/Scope**: Multi-user support with proper authentication and authorization

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- ✅ **Spec-First Development**: Spec exists at `specs/002-fullstack-web-todo/spec.md` with complete requirements
- ✅ **No Manual Coding**: All code will be generated by Claude Code AI agent
- ✅ **Agentic Execution Model**: Plan follows structured approach for AI agent execution
- ✅ **Incremental Evolution**: Building on Phase I (CLI) foundation as required by constitution
- ✅ **Reproducibility Through Documentation**: Plan will generate PHRs and track all decisions
- ✅ **Cloud-Native Architecture**: Using stateless services with PostgreSQL for persistence
- ✅ **Technology Stack Consistency**: Using approved technologies (Python/FastAPI, Next.js, PostgreSQL)
- ✅ **Phase-Specific Constraints**: Meeting Phase II requirements (database + authentication + web UI)

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application) selected with separate backend and frontend directories to maintain clear separation of concerns between client and server code.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 0: Research & Analysis
- ✅ Researched JWT authentication patterns with FastAPI and Better Auth
- ✅ Analyzed Next.js 16+ App Router best practices for authentication
- ✅ Investigated SQLModel integration with Neon PostgreSQL
- ✅ Defined API contract patterns for todo operations with user isolation

### Phase 1: Design & Architecture
- ✅ Designed data models for User, Task, and Authentication Token
- ✅ Created API contracts for authentication and todo endpoints
- ✅ Defined authentication middleware and user isolation patterns
- ✅ Planned database schema with proper relationships and constraints

### Phase 2: Implementation
- Set up monorepo structure with backend and frontend directories
- Implement database models and connection layer
- Build authentication system with JWT token generation and validation
- Create secure API endpoints with user isolation
- Develop frontend with authentication flows and task management UI
- Implement API client with JWT token handling
